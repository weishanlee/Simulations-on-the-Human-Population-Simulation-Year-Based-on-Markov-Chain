# Simulations on the Human Population Simulation Year Based on Markov Chain

This code simulates the global human population from Year 2019 to the saturated 
year with the Discrete-time Markov Chain (after imposing the maximum number of 
population), and compares the results calculated with T-Function in Ref[1].
Data from Ref[2] is also shown for comparison reasons.
